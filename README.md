# Murmur — a full-stack social network (Twitter/X-style)

> *Where the world thinks out loud.*

A working social network built with a RESTful Node.js/Express + Prisma backend and
a React + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend, with Socket.io for realtime notifications
and direct messages. All data is persisted in a real database — there are no mocks.

The project runs out-of-the-box on **SQLite** (zero install) and can switch to
**PostgreSQL** for production by changing one line (see *Database* below).

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- For the default setup: **nothing else** — SQLite is file-based.
- For production: **PostgreSQL** ≥ 13 (optional, see *Database*).

---

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
# from the repository root
cd social-network
```

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # (Windows cmd: copy .env.example .env)
```

The committed `.env.example` defaults to SQLite, so you usually only need to set
the JWT secrets:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<random string>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<random string>
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

Optional Google sign-in:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<google oauth client id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<google oauth client secret>
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/auth/google/callback
```

In Google Cloud Console, add this authorized redirect URI:
`http://localhost:4000/api/auth/google/callback`.

Create the database schema and start the server:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate        # creates dev.db and applies migrations
npm run prisma:generate       # (usually run automatically by migrate)

# start the API + WebSocket server on http://localhost:4000
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # VITE_API_URL defaults to http://localhost:4000
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** and create an account to get started.

> **Password reset in dev:** there is no email provider configured, so
> `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` returns the reset token directly in the JSON
> response (only outside production). The Forgot-password screen surfaces a
> "Continue to reset" link using it.

### WebSocket events (Socket.io)
Authenticate by passing the access token in the handshake `auth.token`.

- Server → client: `notification:new`, `notification:count`, `dm:new`, `dm:typing`, `dm:read`, `post:counts`
- Client → server: `post:subscribe`/`post:unsubscribe` (live counts), `dm:typing`, `dm:read`

---

## 🔐 Security

- **Passwords** hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds).
- **JWT access tokens** are short-lived and kept in memory (not localStorage);
  **refresh tokens** are random, stored only as SHA-256 hashes, rotated on use,
  and delivered via an httpOnly cookie scoped to `/api/auth`.
- **SQL injection**: all DB access goes through Prisma's parameterised queries.
- **XSS**: post content is rendered as React text nodes / elements — never via
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- **Validation**: every endpoint validates input with zod (mirrored on the client).
- **Rate limiting**: global limiter + stricter limiters on auth and write endpoints.
- **Headers/CORS**: `helmet` security headers; CORS restricted to `CLIENT_URL`.

## 🛠 Useful commands

```bash
# server
npm run dev              # dev server with reload
npm run build            # compile TypeScript to dist/
npm start                # run compiled server
npm run prisma:studio    # browse the DB in Prisma Studio
npm run prisma:migrate   # create & apply a migration

# client
npm run dev              # Vite dev server
npm run build            # production build
npm run preview          # preview the production build
```

---

## 🗄 Database — SQLite ↔ PostgreSQL

The app ships configured for **SQLite** so it runs with zero setup. To use
**PostgreSQL** (the production target):

1. In `server/prisma/schema.prisma`, set `provider = "postgresql"`.
2. In `server/.env`, point `DATABASE_URL` at your Postgres instance.
3. Run `npm run prisma:migrate` again.

The data model is written to work on both engines (enums are stored as strings,
and no engine-specific column types are used).

---

## Permanent photo storage

Local development needs no extra setup: uploads are saved under
`server/uploads`.

Render's filesystem is temporary, so production uploads should use Cloudinary:

1. Create a Cloudinary account and open the API Keys page.
2. In the Render service environment, set `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`,
   `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`.
3. Redeploy the backend.

`CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=murmur` is optional. After the three credentials are set,
new post media, avatars, banners, and chat images are uploaded to Cloudinary
automatically. Existing local files are left unchanged.

---

## 📝 Notes & possible extensions

- Media is stored on local disk under `server/uploads` during development.
  For production, set `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and
  `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`; new post media, avatars, banners, and chat images
  will then be stored permanently in Cloudinary.
- Email delivery for password resets is intentionally stubbed (token returned in
  dev). Wire up a provider (e.g. SES/Resend) in `auth.service.ts`.
- The ranking algorithm in `feed.service.ts` is deliberately simple
  (engagement with time decay) and is a good place to iterate.
